# New in version 1.2.0

**Personas** 

You can now create and use different Personas when you connect and share. Personas let you have separate feeds and sets of peers so you don't have to share everything with everyone you're connected to. Each persona has it's own identity and sharing token so you can establish completely separate identities (or personas) for different situations.

**Experience updates and bugfixes**
- Removed username from keystore password entry screen at startup
- Various stability and quality fixes

_If you're upgrading from an earlier version_ - you will need to re-install the Chrome extension. See below for instructions.
